# Next Steps for K8sMed Development

This document outlines the proposed next steps for the K8sMed project, focusing on developing core functionality and moving from a conceptual stage to a usable tool.

## Immediate Tasks

### Core Functionality
1. **Implement Pod Analyzer**
   - Complete the pod analyzer to detect common pod issues (CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, etc.)
   - Add detailed root cause analysis logic
   - Create remediation templates

2. **Implement Kubernetes Data Collectors**
   - Finalize the collector implementations for pods, deployments, services
   - Add log collection functionality
   - Add event collection with filtering

3. **Enhance AI Integration**
   - Develop specialized prompts for different resource types
   - Implement context handling for the interactive mode
   - Fine-tune anonymization patterns for better data privacy

### User Experience
1. **Better Command-Line Output**
   - Implement colorized output for different severity levels
   - Add progress indicators for longer operations
   - Create a consistent output format

2. **Interactive Mode**
   - Implement a full interactive troubleshooting session
   - Add history and context handling
   - Support multi-step remediation workflows

### Documentation
1. **User Documentation**
   - Create detailed usage examples
   - Document all commands and options
   - Provide installation guides for different environments

2. **Developer Documentation**
   - Add detailed design docs
   - Create contributor guidelines with code examples
   - Document extension points for analyzers

## Medium-Term Goals

1. **Kubernetes Operator**
   - Design the operator architecture
   - Implement periodic scanning
   - Create custom resources for scan results
   - Implement alerting based on findings

2. **Additional Resource Support**
   - Add support for StatefulSets, DaemonSets
   - Implement analyzers for networking resources (Services, Ingress)
   - Create analyzers for storage resources (PVs, PVCs)

3. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Add webhook support for CI/CD integration
   - Create plugins for popular monitoring tools
   - Develop notification system for alerts

## Long-Term Vision

1. **Advanced AI Features**
   - Implement history-based pattern recognition
   - Support knowledge base building from past incidents
   - Add predictive analytics for potential issues

2. **Community Building**
   - Establish a plugin ecosystem
   - Create a knowledge sharing platform for remediation strategies
   - Build a community of contributors

3. **Enterprise Features**
   - Multi-cluster support
   - Team collaboration features
   - Compliance and audit capabilities
